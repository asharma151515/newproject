Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
    This error will happen if the numbers entered are not numbers
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
    This error will happen if the denominator enters is 0
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
    This can be added by adding a validation loop that prevents zero from being entered as a denominator
