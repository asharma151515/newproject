**Q1) Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:**

**1.regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy
improve during the course of the subject?**
I encountered difficulties in accurately identifying and grasping the underlying logic within the code, I struggled to understand the code,
and it made finishing the assignments harder for me

**2.regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?** 
Reviewing code nd being analysing our classmate code is nice ,and that lets us know what each other mistakes and what need to implement for the next time

**3.regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?**
 I would make the practical tasks more accessible and less code-heavy. Focus on practical applications 
and real-world examples to make it more engaging and enjoyable for students like me
